## Current Phase Detail

### Phase 3 — Projects, Tasks, Clients, Tags — ✅ Completed

#### Steps Completed
- [x] Step 3.1 — Backend Models: Created and verified SQLAlchemy models.
- [x] Step 3.2 — Backend Schemas: Built Pydantic models with financial isolation logic for viewers.
- [x] Step 3.3 — Client Service & Router: Full CRUD endpoints.
- [x] Step 3.4 — Project Service & Router: Includes archiving and robust visibility control (`public` vs `private`).
- [x] Step 3.5 — Task Service & Router: Handled assignee validation and fallback hourly rates.
- [x] Step 3.6 — Tag Service & Router: Full CRUD endpoints.
- [x] Step 3.7 — Phase 3 Tests: Automated tests maintaining 100% test pass rate and high coverage.
- [x] Step 3.8 — Shared Components Library: Built UI components (`ColorPicker`, `ProjectTag`, `StatusBadge`).
- [x] Step 3.9 — Projects API + Hooks: Integrated React Query with optimistic UI capabilities.
- [x] Step 3.10 — Projects List Page: Implemented filterable grid and "Create Project" flow.
- [x] Step 3.11 — Project Detail Page: Deep-dive view featuring nested tabs and integrated Task management.
- [x] Step 3.12 — Clients + Tags Settings Pages: Built complete setting panels for workspace clients and tags management.

#### Decisions Made
- `ColorPicker` uses `render` prop explicitly for Base UI Popover triggers and gracefully handles nullish DB color values.
- Used `useWorkspaceStore` globally to handle cache scopes and prevent cross-workspace data bleed in hooks.

#### Issues / Bugs Discovered and Resolved
- Fixed minor TypeScript mismatch in `ColorPicker` by modifying props to securely accept `string | null` from API DTOs.
- Ensured `useWorkspace` correctly fetched the workspaceId globally, bypassing React-Router constraint complexities via Zustand.

## Architecture Decisions Log

*(Record any significant implementation decisions here for future reference)*

| Date | Decision | Rationale | Document Reference |
|------|----------|-----------|-------------------|
| 2026-05-26 | DB Schema v2.1 — saved_report_views CHECK constraint includes 'weekly' | Required by new Weekly Report feature (PRD v1.3 §3.8) | DB Schema v2.1 §5 |
| 2026-05-26 | Continue/Duplicate return null in UI for pending entries (not disabled) | Prevents ambiguous interaction with entries under review | PRD v1.3 §7 · Blueprint v2.0 §11 |
| 2026-05-26 | Rate snapshot is always fresh on continue/duplicate (never inherited) | Prevents stale rate data propagating into new entries | PRD v1.3 §5 · TRD v1.2 §6.6 |
| 2026-05-31 | Synthetic WorkspaceMember written via `__dict__` not attribute assignment | SQLAlchemy class-level descriptors intercept both direct assignment and object.__setattr__; __dict__ bypass is the only descriptor-safe approach | Phase 1.5 implementation |
| 2026-05-31 | Hand-written Alembic migration for is_superadmin column | Autogenerate detects Phase 2+ tables (in DB but not yet in models) as "removed"; targeted migration is required to avoid data loss | Phase 1.5 implementation |
